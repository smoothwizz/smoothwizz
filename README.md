# Hi there! 👋

## 👨‍💻 Full-Stack Web Developer | Problem Solver | Continuous Learner

⤷ Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I've been on a coding journey since high school, one that’s taken me through more than ten years of learning, growing, and creating in the world of technology. It’s been a path of curiosity, leading me from one project to another with the constant aim of making things a little better, a bit more user-friendly.

Feel free to connect with me. Let's build something incredible together! 🚀
