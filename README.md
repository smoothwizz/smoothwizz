ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Mares. I'm a frontend engineer with a keen eye for design. Started working as a programmer in 2015, 
mainly focusing on creating and maintaining modern frontend web applications. My role is to make sure that websites 
and apps work correctly from the user perspective.

I live in Romania, married to a wonderful wife and been alive since 93'. 
Beside being obsessed with the web, I also enjoy cycling, basketball and visiting new cities.
